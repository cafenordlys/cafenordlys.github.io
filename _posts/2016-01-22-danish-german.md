Café Nordlys is a Danish / German vocal group, which offers live vocal jazz with reference to the major Danish songbook. The group combines well-known folk melodies with the unmistakable harmonies, pulsating rhythm and improvisational character of jazz music.

The repertoire comprises both traditional Christmas carols, jazz standards as well as other seasonal familiar songs (from evocative and lighthearted spring and summer tunes to the more melancholy of autumn). Thus our set list covers a wide range of different music adaptable according to wish, festive occasion and musical context; whether it serves as background entertainment or as an actual concert performance.

We have contact to experienced musicians from the jazz scene in and around Munich and can put together a group with different instrumental combinations; everything from a full orchestra to the intimate crew combining song with guitar accompaniment for example.
